# p a d s e e k

> padseek is a module-based drum sequencer made with love and javascript. this is an ongoing project, so things might be wonky here and there while I work out the kinks. please feel free to keep checking in for more features and add-ons

**`how to operate`**

- choose a tempo for your sequence via the 'tempo (beats per minute)' field inside of the 'sequence controls' module
- activate your selected pad pieces inside the 'drum pad' module (optionally: duplicate existing pads)
- choose the drum samples that fit your sequence through the 'sample selection' module
- press 'play sequence' or 'pause sequence' to do exactly what that says
- see modules below

**`keyboard shortcuts`**
